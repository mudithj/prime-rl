# Multimodal (VLM) Support

Prime-RL supports training vision-language models (VLMs) like Qwen3-VL.

## VLM Configuration

### Supported Models

The built-in registry supports these model families out of the box:

| Model Family | model_type | Vision Encoder | Language Model |
|-------------|------------|---------------|----------------|
| Qwen3-VL | `qwen3_vl` | `model.visual` | `model.language_model` |
| Qwen3.5 | `qwen3_5` | `model.visual` | `model.language_model` |
| Qwen3.5-MoE | `qwen3_5_moe` | `model.visual` | `model.language_model` |

Enable VLM mode by adding a `[model.vlm]` section. Both fields are required — they tell prime-rl where the vision encoder and language model live on the model object:

```toml
[model]
name = "Qwen/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct"

[model.vlm]
vision_encoder_attr = "model.visual"
language_model_attr = "model.language_model"
```

For the registered models in the table above, use the attrs shown there. For custom VLMs, check your model's structure with `model.named_children()`.

Both fields are dotted attribute paths resolved on the loaded model. A bad path raises a `ValueError` immediately — there are no silent fallbacks.

The weight key prefix for NCCL broadcasting is derived automatically as `{language_model_attr}.layers.`.

To add permanent support for a new model family, add an entry to `VLM_REGISTRY` in `src/prime_rl/utils/vlm.py`.

## Current Limitations

- **Vision encoder is frozen**: The vision encoder is automatically frozen during training. Only the language model is trained.

- **Multimodal samples that exceed `seq_len` are skipped**: Truncating a multimodal sample would break the alignment between image tokens and `pixel_values`. Instead of producing corrupt training data, such samples are dropped with a warning. Ensure `seq_len` covers your longest VLM samples or reduce rollout length.

- **Keep `max_model_len` large for VLMs**: vLLM's tokenizer left-truncates prompts that exceed `max_model_len - max_tokens`, which can silently chop image placeholder tokens from early images while `pixel_values` remain intact. This causes a fatal mismatch at training time. With the model's default context length (e.g. 32768) this never happens, but if you reduce `max_model_len` for memory reasons, make sure it's large enough to fit your longest expanded VLM prompt.

- **Optimization dtype must be bfloat16**: Set `optimization_dtype = "bfloat16"` and `reduce_dtype = "bfloat16"` in your trainer config.

- **Higher KL mismatch with multi-image inputs**: VLM training exhibits higher KL mismatch compared to text-only, especially with multiple images.

- **Images are not logged**: The images the VLM sees during training are not logged to monitors.

## How Multi-Turn VLM RL Training Works

VLM training uses the same `interleave_rollout` path as text-only models. Multi-turn trajectory steps are merged into a single training sample wherever the extension property holds.

Images are handled via a `VLMImageCache` built once per batch:

1. **Extract**: Base64 images are decoded from trajectory step prompts into PIL images.
2. **Preprocess**: Images are processed through the HuggingFace image processor, producing `pixel_values` and `image_grid_thw`.
3. **Attach**: Each training sample receives the cumulative `pixel_values` up to its last merged step.

Each multimodal sample becomes its own micro-batch during training (no packing) since image tensor sizes vary.

## vLLM Configuration

`VLLM_WORKER_MULTIPROC_METHOD=spawn` is required for VLM inference. This is set automatically when using `uv run rl @ ...`, but if you start the vLLM server yourself, make sure this environment variable is set.
